## Mercyhurst University Alumni Data Scientist Project  
**Mercyhurst University**  
February 2025 – May 2025

### Overview
Collaborated with a four-person team to clean, enrich, and structure alumni datasets to improve outreach targeting and engagement analytics for the University Advancement team.

### Environment
- Team-based data analysis project  
- Structured datasets containing alumni records  
- OSINT techniques for data enrichment  
- Data cleaning and normalization workflows  

### Objectives
- Improve dataset accuracy and completeness  
- Reduce duplication and inconsistent formatting  
- Enrich records using publicly available information  
- Deliver structured datasets for analytical use  

### Implementation
Performed data cleaning, normalization, and validation across alumni records.  

Applied open-source intelligence (OSINT) techniques to enrich missing or outdated data fields while maintaining ethical and privacy boundaries.  

Standardized outputs to ensure compatibility with institutional analytics workflows.

### Security Considerations
- Responsible use of publicly available information  
- Data minimization principles  
- Structured handling of personally identifiable information (PII)  
- Ethical OSINT methodology  

### Outcome
Delivered structured, enriched datasets to the University Advancement team to support improved outreach and engagement strategies.  

Gained experience in collaborative data workflows, information validation, and privacy-aware data handling practices.
