Security Research | Systems Hardening | Defensive Engineering

This repository contains the source for my professional security portfolio.  
It highlights research, lab-based experimentation, defensive engineering projects, and certifications.

## Professional Focus

My work centers on defensive security engineering, system hardening, and threat-informed analysis.  
I am particularly interested in:

- Endpoint hardening and patch management
- Privilege boundary enforcement
- Attack surface reduction
- Threat modeling and risk analysis
- Secure configuration baselines
- Hybrid infrastructure security

All research published here is conducted in controlled lab environments.

## Repository Structure

- `/research` – Technical research summaries and whitepapers  
- `/projects` – Practical implementation and lab-based security engineering work  
- `/certifications` – Professional certifications  
- `/security` – Responsible disclosure and security policy  
- `/assets` – Supporting documents and sanitized technical briefs

## Technical Philosophy

Security should be engineered, not reacted to.

My approach emphasizes:

- Measured risk assessment over exploit sensationalism
- Baseline hardening before advanced tooling
- Configuration discipline over reactive patching
- Clear documentation of methodology and impact

I value reproducibility, clarity, and responsible publication.

## Tooling & Environment

Lab environments are built using:

- Virtualized infrastructure
- Isolated Active Directory domains
- Controlled network segmentation
- Standard defensive security tooling

Tool selection prioritizes visibility, control validation, and configuration integrity.
