## Post-Quantum Cryptography Research Project  
**Mercyhurst University**  
February 2024 – April 2024

### Overview
Co-authored a research paper analyzing emerging quantum and post-quantum cryptographic standards, with emphasis on real-world protocol integration and long-term security implications.

### Environment
- Academic research environment  
- Standards documentation review (NIST publications)  
- Protocol analysis of publicly documented implementations  

### Objectives
- Analyze the impact of quantum computing on classical cryptographic systems  
- Evaluate NIST post-quantum cryptography finalists  
- Examine real-world adoption of post-quantum key exchange mechanisms  

### Implementation
Conducted structured analysis of the NIST finalist **CRYSTALS-Kyber**, focusing on its lattice-based construction and resistance to quantum adversaries.  

Evaluated integration into:
- Signal’s Post-Quantum Extended Diffie-Hellman (PQXDH) protocol  
- Apple’s PQ3 post-quantum messaging enhancements  

Compared implementation tradeoffs including performance, key sizes, and forward secrecy considerations.

### Security Considerations
- Long-term confidentiality risks posed by quantum adversaries  
- Hybrid key exchange models combining classical + post-quantum primitives  
- Migration challenges for large-scale secure messaging platforms  

### Outcome
Delivered a co-authored research paper detailing cryptographic transition strategies and real-world adoption pathways.  

Strengthened applied understanding of cryptographic standards, protocol design tradeoffs, and future-proofing secure communications.
