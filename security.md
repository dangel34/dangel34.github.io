# Security & Responsible Disclosure

This portfolio contains research conducted in isolated lab environments.

No production systems were tested without authorization.

All configurations, vulnerabilities, and architectural examples have been sanitized to remove:
- Internal identifiers
- Network topology specifics
- Hostnames or IP addressing
- Sensitive metadata

The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate defensive security engineering, research methodology, and risk analysis — not exploit publication.

If you have concerns regarding any published material, please contact me directly.
