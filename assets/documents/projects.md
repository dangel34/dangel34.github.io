## Post-Quantum Cryptography Research Project  
**Mercyhurst University**  
February 2024 – April 2024

### Overview
Co-authored a research paper analyzing emerging quantum and post-quantum cryptographic standards, with emphasis on real-world protocol integration and long-term security implications.

### Environment
- Academic research environment  
- Standards documentation review (NIST publications)  
- Protocol analysis of publicly documented implementations  

### Objectives
- Analyze the impact of quantum computing on classical cryptographic systems  
- Evaluate NIST post-quantum cryptography finalists  
- Examine real-world adoption of post-quantum key exchange mechanisms  

### Implementation
Conducted structured analysis of the NIST finalist **CRYSTALS-Kyber**, focusing on its lattice-based construction and resistance to quantum adversaries.  

Evaluated integration into:
- Signal’s Post-Quantum Extended Diffie-Hellman (PQXDH) protocol  
- Apple’s PQ3 post-quantum messaging enhancements  

Compared implementation tradeoffs including performance, key sizes, and forward secrecy considerations.

### Security Considerations
- Long-term confidentiality risks posed by quantum adversaries  
- Hybrid key exchange models combining classical + post-quantum primitives  
- Migration challenges for large-scale secure messaging platforms  

### Outcome
Delivered a co-authored research paper detailing cryptographic transition strategies and real-world adoption pathways.  

Strengthened applied understanding of cryptographic standards, protocol design tradeoffs, and future-proofing secure communications.

## Mercyhurst University Alumni Data Scientist Project  
**Mercyhurst University**  
February 2025 – May 2025

### Overview
Collaborated with a four-person team to clean, enrich, and structure alumni datasets to improve outreach targeting and engagement analytics for the University Advancement team.

### Environment
- Team-based data analysis project  
- Structured datasets containing alumni records  
- OSINT techniques for data enrichment  
- Data cleaning and normalization workflows  

### Objectives
- Improve dataset accuracy and completeness  
- Reduce duplication and inconsistent formatting  
- Enrich records using publicly available information  
- Deliver structured datasets for analytical use  

### Implementation
Performed data cleaning, normalization, and validation across alumni records.  

Applied open-source intelligence (OSINT) techniques to enrich missing or outdated data fields while maintaining ethical and privacy boundaries.  

Standardized outputs to ensure compatibility with institutional analytics workflows.

### Security Considerations
- Responsible use of publicly available information  
- Data minimization principles  
- Structured handling of personally identifiable information (PII)  
- Ethical OSINT methodology  

### Outcome
Delivered structured, enriched datasets to the University Advancement team to support improved outreach and engagement strategies.  

Gained experience in collaborative data workflows, information validation, and privacy-aware data handling practices.
